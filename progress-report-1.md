1.I was able to bring my all the web app content in the form of coding by using HTML,CSS and PHP.

2.I think i was achieved my previous goals as i want.For example i want to use some PHP coding in my web app as well
as i want to use some database by using PHP myadmin to make my web app more flexible so that changes will be easily
 made to my web app.
 
 3.In this week i want to make my lists page fully functional and i supposed that it displays list of only
 checked items rather than unchechecked grocery items to the end user.I want to do this by using some JS code in my web app.
 
 4.I learned to bring data items with checkboxes in my web app.As well as i learned some more PHP coding to bring my images from phpmyadmin table to my web 
 app through coding.
 
 5.I enjoyed the starting coding very much.I was able to achieved which i was want according to my requirement easily by using HTML and CSS and CSS coding.I enjoyed a lot
 to bring my all web app images as well as content of my web app in the form of coding from designing through HTML.I enjoyed HTML coding soo much.
 
 6.The most frustrating part of my web app is lists page.On the lists page i just want to display list of items with chekboxes in the form of table. At the very 
 first time i made a table in HTML as i feel much comfortable with HTML coding.But suddenly i remember that after this how i will be able to make any changes
 in my lists page through HTML coding.After that i convert my table into database form by using phpmyadmin.But until now i am unable to bring only checked items.
 in my lists page.I am still working on it.
 
 7.Yes,I  just want to make some changes in designing part only for my web app.Otherwise all links for my web app are perfect according to my thinking.
